I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com/products/machine-learning-agents) contributing to [ML-agents toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). My focus is on leveraging Reinforcement and imitation learning to training intelligent agents, including providing a user-friendly package for state of the art methods and maintaining an open source project.

I received my Master's degree degree under supervision of [Dr. Alona Fyshe](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~alona/) from Computer Science Department University of Victoria where I studied Natural language processing (NLP), machine learning and their applications to understand language composition in human brain.
